### Individual Assessment regarding data vizualisation

In the context of a Data Visualization  course, we had to create a visualisation for a dataset of our choice. 
I chose a Dataset created by Sameer Patel on Kaggle.com, that was obtained by scrapping data from wikipÃ©dia about Disney Movies.

My graphs are created using Python and JavaScript, then reported in HTML webpage.
